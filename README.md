# VUT-IAL-projects (2022/2023)

## Tasks

The goal of these tasks was to understand the principles of commonly used data structures:

- single-linked lists,
- arrays,
- double-linked lists,
- binary trees,
- hash tables.

**Task 1** consisted out of the first 3 points and the **task 2** of the last 2 points.

### Testing

I tested both tasks on these systems:

- Windows 11
- Ubuntu 22.04
- Merlin (our Linux school server)

## Sorting algorithms

I also decided that it would be good to understand different sorting techniques, so I programmed some of them to see and debug, or just to inspect and better understand what they could be useful for.
These algorithms are located in `sorting/.` folder and I compiled them using `gcc` compiler, so it should work well on any OS with this compiler.

### Compilation

To compile the project, you can use the included `Makefile`, which should work fine or you can also compile it yourself.

## Final evaluation

- Task 1: 7.75/10
- Task 2: 10/10
